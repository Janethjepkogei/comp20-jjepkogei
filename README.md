A reflection of what I learned throughout the Fall 2015 semester in Comp 20


My favorite assignment was creating the mapchat server. I realized that I love working on the server
side of a web application more than the frontend/client side. From this assignemnt I also learned about 
databases and different frameworks that can be used. I also got a lot clarified from my initial 
understanding of what a server is and how it works.

I think I have grown a lot. I began the course very confused and misguided about some concepts but the 
projects, assignments and labs really helped me to understand and clarify things.


I learned to use various APIs and at the moment, I am confident that given any task that invlolves using APIs, 
I should be able to implement it comfortably. A good and simple example is using facebook API for 
authentication in web application. Use of Geolocation API is also another example. The biggest 
challenge, however, was documentation. Most APIs are really poorly documented. But I guess that is why you are 
a hacker, somehow you have to figure it out.

I also learned how the client and the server talk to each other. Initially like I said I have a really 
vague idea about how the two work but now I understand and know how to implement them side by side. 

I really want to learn more about servers and databases. These are the things I am more interested
in. I want to take a Networks and databases class so as to understand more about HTTP, HTTPS, 
server optimization and databases languages.
